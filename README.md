I'm not sure exactly what I want to write _yet_.
But I know I want to learn in public and build in the open.

Things that I will probably write there:

- who I am
- which projects I code at work
- which projects I work on / maintain
- what I learn these days

Subjects the blog would evoke:

- ASTs & compilers
- Creative use of things like unist
- Writing build plugins more often
- TryCereals

In the process, I would like to understand why I'm sometimes good and sometimes not.
