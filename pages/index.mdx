I have spent these last 5 years building stuff for the web - for myself first, and since 2019 at Prismic.
I _mostly_ write Javascript but had a prior (one-way) love for C.
These are the things I am interested in and want to get better at:

- JS/Jamstack build plugins and tools&nbsp;
<Serif bold as="span"><AnchorLink href="#note-1">[1]</AnchorLink></Serif>
- Creative uses of ASTs & compilers&nbsp;
<Serif bold as="span"><AnchorLink href="#note-2">[2]</AnchorLink></Serif>
- Writing code that produces code&nbsp;
<Serif bold as="span"><AnchorLink href="#note-3">[3]</AnchorLink></Serif>

Although I've been coding for some years now, I consider myself far from being a proven dev yet. Iâ€™ve struggled at achieving things for a long time and I need to gain a better understanding of what helps me succeed and what does not.

##### this year
I have been working on somehting intersting. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make.

I algo got diagnosed with tinnitus.
It's been super rough I and still try to think of how I'm going to live my life.

  [1] Creative uses of syntax trees. Like this attempt.

  [2] See TryCereals.

<Serif bold sx={{ mb: 1, px: 0, fontSize: '15px', color: '#111' }}>
  [3] I'm super inspired by <em>blocks-ui</em>, which brings design and code altogher by outputting production-ready JSX.
  Things that output Domain-specific language permits a low-coding approach that I want to explore more & more.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.. To finish, it connected the two
and triggered a new deployment!
